# HIL Run Log - 2026-02-12 (HV60 v4.4.3)

## Environment
- Date (UTC): `2026-02-12`
- Host: Ubuntu workstation
- Device: RoboClaw HV60 2x60A
- Firmware: `USB Roboclaw HV60 2x60A v4.4.3`
- Port: `/dev/ttyACM0`

## Initial Observations
- Device initially responded at address `0x80`.
- During verify testing, communication moved to address `0x86`.
- `info` was stable at `0x86` (3/3 successful reads).

## Command Results
- `list`: pass
- `info`: pass (at `0x86` during run)
- `dump`: pass
- `flash --config ...` (without verify): pass
- `flash --config ... --verify`: failed with timeout on `ReadNVM` (`cmd 0x5f`)
- `test --recipe smoke_v1 --csv`: pass

## Artifact Evidence
- `reports/2026-02-12T230123Z_flash_ttyACM0_0x86.json` (verify-timeout failure artifact)
- `reports/2026-02-12T230129Z_test_ttyACM0_0x86.json` (successful smoke run)
- `reports/2026-02-12T230129Z_test_telemetry_ttyACM0_0x86.csv`
- `reports/2026-02-12T230400Z_flash_ttyACM0_0x86.json` (flash without verify)

## Known Caveat Found
- Verify path (`ReadNVM`) intermittently times out after write-to-NVM on this hardware/firmware combination.
- Manual readback (`dump`) confirmed requested parameters remained applied despite verify timeout.

## Safety Outcome
- Smoke recipe completed successfully with telemetry.
- Controller state was returned to initial settings at end of session:
- address restored to `0x80`
- config/mode/current limits matched pre-run backup
