# HIL Run Log - 2026-02-12

## Environment
- Timestamp (UTC): `2026-02-12T22:21:19Z`
- Host: this development environment (no attached RoboClaw hardware detected)
- Target scan paths: `/dev/ttyACM*`, `/dev/ttyUSB*`

## Checklist Execution Summary
- `roboclaw list`: executed, no ports returned.
- `roboclaw info --port /dev/ttyACM0`: executed, failed with `no_response` (port missing).
- `roboclaw dump --port /dev/ttyACM0`: executed, failed with `no_response` (port missing).
- `roboclaw flash --port /dev/ttyACM0 --config ... --verify`: executed, failed with `no_response`, JSON report emitted.
- `roboclaw test --port /dev/ttyACM0 --recipe smoke_v1`: executed, failed with `no_response`, JSON report emitted.

## Artifacts Produced
- `reports/2026-02-12T222144Z_flash_ttyACM0_0x80.json`
- `reports/2026-02-12T222144Z_test_ttyACM0_0x80.json`

## Blockers
- No physical RoboClaw device enumerated on this host, so true HIL validation (motion/config persistence on hardware) is still pending.
